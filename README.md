Internome (Client)
===============================
Introduction
------------
The best way to increase endurance in any given physical activity is via interval training: short bursts of intense exercise punctuated by perios of fairly low-intesity training. As a drummer, I have been frustrated by the lack of resources available to help me get better as a player.

It is hoped that this application will remedy at least some of the this frustration. The basic idea is to have the application play metronomic clicks at increasing and decreasing tempo, allowing the practitioner to practice ruduments or patterns (or scales) to intervals to increase endurance and dexterity.

For more information about drumming please visit the [Percussive Arts Society](https://www.pas.org/). NOTE: ALthough a lot of their resources used to be free (to use), you now unfortunately have to be a member to utilize many of their resources.

For notes about the Back End, please see the README [here](https://github.com/gbbenson68/internome-api).

The client is deployed on GitHub Pages and can be found [here](https://gbbenson68.github.io/internome-client/).

Technologies Used
-----------------
The web application client was written with the help of and utilizing the following technologies:
*   HTML
*   JavaScript
*   React
*   CSS/SASS/Bootstrap
*   Node.js
*   git/GitHub
*   Atom
*   All colors were derived with the help of <https://www.quackit.com/css/css_color_codes.cfm>.
*   Hosted by GitHub Pages.

_This application was developed on Ubuntu 18.04.2 LTS. No Microsoft developers were harmed during the making of this application._

Development and Planning
------------------------
*   TO DO

#### Data Validation
Most of the data is validated by the HTML (via JSX), so that no crap data can be entered. All entered numebers must be integer values.

Wireframes
----------
The wireframe for this is kinda simple.

User Stories
------------
Must haves:

1.  As a user I want to be able to specify a minimum starting tempo.
2.  As a user, I want to be able to specify a maximum peak tempo.
3.  As a user, I want to be able to specify the number of intervals.
4.  As a user, I want to be able to specify the duration of the session.
5.  As a sign-in user, I want to be able to save my settings in a named profile that can be used later.

Nice to haves/wish list:

1.  As a signed-in user, I want to be able to have my session visualized so that I can picture where I am (in the session) and what is left.
2.  As a signed-in user, I want to be able to choose from several types of simple interval training routines.

About Me
--------
I am an aerospace engineer by education and a software engineer by experience. Iâ€™ve always been intrigued by using software to solve practical problems, whether it be something as simple as providing an HTML interface for viewing invoices or something as complex as modeling the fluid flow through a rocket thruster. I recently decided to upgrade my skill set with an immersive software engineering program at General Assembly, and I am now taking my ambitions to the next level. I am eager and excited to take on those sometimes seemingly unsurmountable challenges that affect us all.
